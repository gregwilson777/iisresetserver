While running automated tests it's useful to reset the IIS server or take database snapshots at certain points...

This simple server provides a way to:
 - remotely trigger an IIS reset after reconfiguring an IIS application server
 - remotely trigger a database snapshot and storage (via a powershell script that must already exist on the system)
